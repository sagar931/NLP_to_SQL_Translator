NLP to SQL Translator
Overview
This project aims to facilitate the translation of natural language queries into SQL. The primary objective of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to SQL is to simplify database interactions for users. By enabling users to utilize natural language queries instead of intricate SQL code, this system enhances accessibility for both technical and non-technical users.

Key Objectives
Simplify Querying: Allow users to interact with databases using plain English, reducing the need for complex SQL commands.

User-Friendly Insights: Enable non-technical users to derive meaningful insights from datasets effortlessly.

How It Works
The NLP to SQL translator uses advanced natural language processing techniques to interpret user queries and convert them into corresponding SQL queries. This eliminates the need for users to have in-depth SQL knowledge, making data exploration more accessible.
